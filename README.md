# Project 3: Camera Calibration and Fundamental Matrix Estimation with RANSAC

## Getting Started
  - See [Project 0](https://github.gatech.edu/cs4476/project-0) for detailed environment setup.
  - Ensure that you are using the environment cv_proj3, which you can install using the install script conda/install.sh.

---

## Logistics
- Submit via [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).
- Additional information can be found in `docs/project-3.pdf`.

## Important Notes
- Please follow the environment setup in [Project 0](https://github.gatech.edu/cs4476/project-0).
- Do **not** use absolute paths in your code or your code will break.
- Use relative paths like the starter code already does.
- Failure to follow any of these instructions will lead to point deductions. Create the zip file by clicking and hand it in with your report PDF through Gradescope (please remember to mark which parts of your report correspond to each part of the rubric).

## FAQ

### I'm getting [*insert error*] and I don't know how to fix it.

Please check [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google](https://google.com/) first before asking the teaching staff about OS specific installation issues (because that's likely what we will be doing if asked).
